    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup low-fat (2%) milk</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Neufchâtel or low-fat cream cheese</li>
      <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, plus more for topping</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>12 ounces fresh fettuccine</li>
      <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

        Make the sauce: Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the
        garlic and lemon zest and cook until the garlic is slightly soft, about
        1 minute. Add in the flour and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, 1
        minute. Whisk in the milk and 3/4 teaspoon salt and cook, whisking
        constantly, until just thickened, about 3 minutes. Add the Neufchâtel
        and parmesan cheese; whisk until melted, about 1 minute. Stir in the
        chopped parsley.

        Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the
        fettuccine and cook until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes. Reserve 1 cup
        cooking water, then drain the pasta and return to the pot. Add the sauce
        and 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking water to the pasta and gently toss
        to combine, adding more cooking water as needed to loosen. Season with
        salt. Divide among bowls and top with parmesan and pepper.
