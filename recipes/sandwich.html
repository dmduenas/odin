    <h1>Croque Madame Sandwich</h1>
    <img src="../images/sandwich.jpg" />

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 ounces unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
      <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan</li>
      <li>8 slices thick sourdough bread</li>
      <li>8 to 12 slices good quality ham (about 3/4 pound)</li>
      <li>12 ounces Gruyere cheese, grated, divided</li>
      <li>Nonstick spray</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the broiler.</li>
      <li>
        Make the bechamel sauce: In a small saucepan, melt 1 ounce butter over
        medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until you
        smell the flour and butter cooking, 2 to 3 minutes. Do not allow it to
        brown. Add the milk and bay leaf and cook, stirring from time to time,
        until the mixture thickens like a soup, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the bay
        leaf and stir in the Parmesan. Transfer to a bowl to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange 4 slices of the bread on a flat surface. Top each with 2 to 3
        slices of ham. Mix together half of the Gruyere cheese and the bechamel
        sauce. Taste for seasoning. Spread a little of the sauce on top of the
        ham and top each with another slice of bread.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large cast iron skillet and, when hot, add half of the remaining
        butter. Add 2 of the sandwiches and brown on one side, 2 minutes. Turn
        on the other side and brown 2 more minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet
        and repeat with the remaining butter and sandwiches. Spread the
        remaining bechamel on top of the sandwiches and top with the other half
        of the Gruyere cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wipe any crumbs from the cast iron skillet and spray with nonstick
        spray. Crack 4 eggs into the skillet, leaving a little room between
        each. (Alternatively, fry 2 at a time). While the eggs are frying, place
        the sandwiches under the broiler and broil until the top becomes golden
        brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Season the eggs with salt and top each sandwich
        with a fried egg. Serve immediately.
